page 0 contains the user code (eg. initcode for the first process).

page 2 contains the user stack.

user process cant write/read the page 1 since it's the guard page to prevent
stackoverflow.

let srcva = p->sz - PGSIZE
let len = -1

in this case, srcva >= p->sz || srcva+len >= p->sz gives false
and srcva+len < srcva gives true.
